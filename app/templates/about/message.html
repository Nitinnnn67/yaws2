            <p>Greetings to all!</p>
            <p>As the Secretary of this institution, I anticipate the full participation and cooperation of the students and parents to make it possible for us to transform our dreams to reality.<span class="dots" id="dots-secretary">...</span></p>
            <div class="message-expanded" id="more-secretary">
                <p>It is very much apparent that we live today in a world that is so very different from the one we grew up in, the one we were educated in. Change in today's world is riding an accelerated pace and we need to pause and reflect on the entire education system.</p>
                <p>I firmly believe that students must be taught how to think, not what to think. That reminds me of the great words of wisdom by Aristotle, 'Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.' As we impart education to match the advancement of globalized world, we march our children ahead with the ethos of moral and ethical principles.</p>
                <p>We at Saket Gyanpeeth, are committed to continually improve our quality management system and develop our students as intellectually alive and socially responsible citizens, so as to enable them to meet the future development and challenges.</p>

            <p>Warm greetings to all!</p>
            <p>Higher-education is not just a means to enter into a profession but it is the path of transforming a youngster into a complete, responsible and dutiful adult.<span class="dots" id="dots-ceo">...</span></p>
            <div class="message-expanded" id="more-ceo">
                <p>Change is the only constant in the present world and the pace of change is very rapid.</p>
                <p>We prepare students to deal with this ever-changing world and emerge victorious as the change-makers of the world. At Saket College we believe in not just educating students for their professions but also in educating them for leading a successful and happy life as global citizens.</p>
                <p>Apart from professional skills, students are inculcated with life skills which enable them to succeed in even the most averse situations. Present day youngsters are not as emotionally strong as older generations and here at Saket, we train our students in not just intellectual prowess but also mental wellbeing.</p>
                <p>Our professors are our intellectual capital; who are highly trained and passionate about needs of students. I would also mention our non-teaching staff who are the administrative backbone of the institution who keep it running smoothly.</p>
