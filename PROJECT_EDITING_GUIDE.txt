===============================================================================

This guide explains how to edit and modify the college website project.
NO CODING EXPERIENCE REQUIRED - Just follow the step-by-step instructions!

===============================================================================
1. UNDERSTANDING YOUR WEBSITE FOLDER STRUCTURE
===============================================================================

Think of your website like a filing cabinet with organized folders:

üìÅ app/                     
  üìÅ templates/             ‚Üê This is where your website PAGES are stored
  üìÅ static/               ‚Üê This is where IMAGES, PDFs, and styling files go
    üìÅ docs/               ‚Üê Put PDF files here (admission forms, syllabi, etc.)
    üìÅ images/             ‚Üê Put photos here (staff photos, event pictures, etc.)
    üìÅ css/                ‚Üê Website colors and design files (don't touch unless needed)
    üìÅ js/                 ‚Üê Website functionality files (don't touch)
  üìÅ frontend/             ‚Üê Website navigation rules (advanced users only)
  üìÅ models/               ‚Üê Database settings (advanced users only)

üìÅ instance/               ‚Üê Website database files (don't touch)
üìÅ migrations/             ‚Üê Database backup files (don't touch)

SIMPLE RULE: 
- Want to add a PDF? ‚Üí Put it in app/static/docs/
- Want to add a photo? ‚Üí Put it in app/static/images/
- Want to change page content? ‚Üí Edit files in app/templates/

===============================================================================
2. HOW TO ADD A NEW MENU ITEM TO YOUR WEBSITE (STEP-BY-STEP)
===============================================================================

The menu bar at the top of your website is controlled by ONE file.

üéØ GOAL: Add a new menu item like "Events" or "Gallery"

STEP 1: Open the menu file
- Using File Explorer, navigate to your website folder
- Open: app ‚Üí templates ‚Üí base.html
- This file controls what appears in your website's menu

STEP 2: Find the menu section  
- Press Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) to search
- Search for: "About us"
- You'll see a section that looks like a list of menu items

STEP 3: Copy and modify an existing menu
- Find this section (it will look similar):
        <li class="compact-nav-item dropdown">
          <a class="compact-nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" role="button">
            About us <i class="material-icons compact-dropdown-icon"></i>
          </a>
          <ul class="compact-dropdown-menu">
            <li><a class="compact-dropdown-item" href="/about/message">About PRUTSIM</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

- Copy this entire section
- Paste it right after (before the closing </ul>)
- Change "About us" to your new menu name like "Events"
- Change the link "/about/message" to match your new page

STEP 4: Save the file
- Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac)
- Your new menu item will appear on the website!

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: If this seems complicated, ask someone technical to help with this step.
The rest of this guide focuses on easier tasks like uploading files.

7. SIMPLE TROUBLESHOOTING FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS
===============================================================================

‚ùå PROBLEM: I uploaded a PDF but it's not showing on the website

‚úÖ SOLUTION:
1. Check if the PDF is in the right folder: app/static/docs/
2. Make sure the filename matches exactly what you wrote in the page
3. Check for typos in the filename
4. Make sure there are no spaces in the filename (use dashes instead)

‚ùå PROBLEM: I uploaded a photo but it's not appearing

‚úÖ SOLUTION:
1. Check if the image is in the right folder: app/static/images/
2. Make sure it's a .jpg or .png file
3. Check that the filename matches exactly in your page
4. Image files are case-sensitive: "Photo.jpg" is different from "photo.jpg"

‚ùå PROBLEM: I made changes but they're not showing on the website

‚úÖ SOLUTION:
1. Make sure you saved the file (Ctrl+S)
2. Refresh your web browser (F5 or Ctrl+F5)
3. Clear your browser cache (Google "how to clear cache" for your browser)
4. Wait a few minutes - sometimes changes take time to appear

‚ùå PROBLEM: The website looks broken after my changes

‚úÖ SOLUTION:
1. Don't panic! This is fixable
2. Try to remember what you changed

5. Ask for technical help - provide details about what you changed

üí° PREVENTION TIPS:
- Always make a backup copy of files before editing them
- Only change text content, never HTML code (the stuff in < > brackets)
- Test small changes before making big ones
- Keep a list of what you've changed

üÜò WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP:
- If you need to add new menu items
- If you need to create entirely new pages  
- If the website stops working
- If you need to change how things function (not just content)
- If you're not sure about something - it's better to ask!

   - Make one small change and test it
   - If it works, make the next change

3. WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU DO
   - Keep a notebook of changes you make
   - Include file names and what you changed
   - This helps when something goes wrong

üö® WHAT NOT TO TOUCH:

‚ùå NEVER EDIT THESE FOLDERS (unless you're technical):
- app/frontend/
- app/models/
- app/auth/
- app/api/

- Files in app/templates/ (but be careful!)
- Adding files to app/static/docs/

LEVEL 3: Full restore
- Delete entire "app" folder
- Rename "app-backup-[date]" to "app"

LEVEL 4: Ask for help

üí° GOLDEN RULES:
1. When in doubt, don't do it
2. Always backup before changing anything
3. Test changes immediately
4. Use the admin panel when possible (it's safer)
